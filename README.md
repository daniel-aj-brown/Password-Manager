# Password-Manager

A simple password manager app written in c# with wpf.

This project demonstrates how dependency injection can be used to simplify construction of complex objects, and how asynchronous programming can prevent locking up the UI while working on an intensive task.

## Features

- Log in with a master password
- Create, update and delete passwords
- Save changes back to an encrypted database

## Usage

After logging in with your master password:

1) Select a password entry from the list on the left or click New.
2) Edit its details in the details view on the right.
3) Use the Save Changes button to save the data to an encrypted database.
